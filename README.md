# Pre-work - TipCalculator

TipCalculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Mulki Mohamed

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

The only challenge I faced while completing this application was getting stuck on the objectiveC class part and I learned that I should read the instructions more clearly because the solution was there. I also found it really hard trying to upload my project onto gitHub and I just ended up adding the code here manually.
